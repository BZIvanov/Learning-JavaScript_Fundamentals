### Working with the DOM

Nodes on the DOM are of reference type and if we want to copy some node with new reference we can use the following method.

```javascript
let dupNode = node.cloneNode(true);
```

You can read more about the method and other useful methods on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/cloneNode)
